```jsx
const initialProps = {
    onSendMessage: async ({ message, conversation }, stream) => {
        // Implement your logic when user sends a message here
    },
    onCreateConversation: () => { 
        // Implement your logic for when user creates a new conversation here 
    },
    onDeleteConversation: () => { 
        // Implement your logic for when user deletes a conversation here 
    },
    placeholder: "Type your message here...",
    regenerateLimitText: "It looks like I were unable to answer you message. Please try again with a different question.",
    botTypingCaption: "Typing...",
    allowConversations: true,
    bots: [ // List your available chatbots here
        {
            name: "Bot 1",
            description: "Bot 1 description",
            id: 1,
            introMessage: "Hello, my name is bot 1. How can I help you today?",
            suggestions: ["What's franch for 'bread'?", 'How are you doing? (answer as joey from friends)', 'What is the meaning of life?']
        },
        {
            name: "Bot 2",
            description: "Bot 2 description",
            id: 2,
            introMessage: "Hello, my name is bot 2. How can I help you today?",
            suggestions: ["What's english for 'p√£o'?", 'How are you doing? (answer as chewbaca from star wars)', 'Why does the universe exists?']
        }
    ],
    conversations: [ // List your conversations here
        {
            title: "Thread 1",
            description: "Description from thread 1",
            id: 1,
            messages: messages,
            bot: bots[0],
            updatedAt: new Date("2023-06-20")
        },
        {
            title: "Thread 2",
            description: "Descri√ß√£o longa da conversa 2, adicionando mais contexto e informa√ß√µes",
            id: 2,
            messages: messages,
            bot: bots[1],
            updatedAt: new Date("2023-06-20")
